# Task 0: The Blog Post (0-blog_post)

This file should contain the **URL** to your published article on Medium or LinkedIn. To reach the 1,500-word requirement and impress recruiters, follow this logical flow:

## 1. DNS Request (The Phonebook of the Web)

* **Concept:** Your browser doesn't know where "google.com" lives. It sends a request to a DNS recursor (usually your ISP).
* **Process:** The request travels through Root servers, TLD servers (.com), and finally Authoritative servers to find the IP address (e.g., `172.217.7.14`).

## 2. TCP/IP & Firewall

* **Concept:** Once the IP is known, a connection is established using the Transmission Control Protocol.
* **Process:** The "Three-way Handshake" occurs (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
* **Security:** This request must pass through a **Firewall**, which acts as a security guard, filtering traffic based on defined rules to prevent unauthorized access.

## 3. HTTPS/SSL (The Secure Tunnel)

* **Concept:** To protect your data, the connection is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
* **Process:** The browser and server perform an "SSL Handshake" to exchange keys, changing the URL from `http` to `https`.

## 4. Load Balancer & Web Server

* **Concept:** High-traffic sites use a **Load Balancer** to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers so no single server is overwhelmed.
* **Web Server:** The chosen server (like Nginx or Apache) receives the request and handles static content (HTML, CSS).

## 5. Application Server & Database

* **Concept:** If the request requires dynamic data (like your specific search results), the Web Server talks to the **Application Server**.
* **Database:** The Application Server queries the **Database** to retrieve or store information before sending the finished page back to the browser.
