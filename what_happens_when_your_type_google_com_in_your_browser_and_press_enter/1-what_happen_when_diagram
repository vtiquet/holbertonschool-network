# Task 1: The Infrastructure Diagram (1-what_happen_when_diagram)

This file should contain the **URL** to your hosted diagram. Below is a logic map you can use to build your visual in tools like `diagrams.net` or `Mermaid.js`.

## Mermaid Diagram Structure

You can use this code at [Mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/) to generate a schema that covers all requirements:

```mermaid

    DNS --> FW{Firewall Check}
    FW -->|Authorized| LB[Load Balancer: Distribute Traffic]
    LB -->|HTTPS/SSL Encrypted| WS[Web Server: Static Content]
    WS --> AS[Application Server: Logic]
    AS --> DB[(Database: Data Storage)]
    DB --> AS
